# Data-Science-Projects: Model-Building
## About
I have developed a strong foundation in model building and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as a data specialist.

During my courses, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

My CV is in [pdf](https://github.com/Taimoor109/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/main/Taimoor%20Akhtar-Resume.pdf ).

Tips: For data science projects with python, I would recommend you install numpy , pandas , scipy , scikit learn , matplotlib , seaborn these basic libraries.

**Certificate** [Regression Analysis: Simplify Complex Data Relationships](https://github.com/Taimoor109/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Multiple%20linear%20Regression%20Analysis/certificate%20Regression%20Analysis.pdf)

**The purpose** of this project was to demonstrate knowledge of [EDA](https://github.com/Taimoor109/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Multiple%20linear%20Regression%20Analysis/_project%20MLR.pdf) and a multiple linear regression model

**The goal** was to build a multiple linear regression model and evaluate the model

__<u>This activity had three parts:</u>__

**Part 1:** EDA & Checking Model Assumptions
* What are some purposes of EDA before constructing a multiple linear regression model?

**Part 2:** Model Building and Evaluation
* What resources are useful?

**Part 3:** Interpreting Model Results

* What key insights emerged from model(s)?

* What are business recommendations based on the models built?

# Regression Modeling For Marketing And Sales Data
![Alt Text](https://github.com/Taimoor109/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Linear%20Regression%20Model/histo_qqplot.PNG)

In this activity, I used simple linear regression to explore the relationship between two continuous variables. I performed a complete simple linear regression analysis, which included creating and fitting a model, checking model assumptions, analyzing model performance, interpreting model coefficients, and communicating results to stakeholders.

For this activity, I was part of an analytics team that provided insights about marketing and sales. I was assigned to a project that focused on the use of influencer marketing, and I wanted to explore the relationship between marketing promotional budgets and sales. The dataset provided included information about marketing campaigns across TV, radio, and social media, as well as how much revenue in sales was generated from these campaigns. Based on this information, leaders in my company would make decisions about where to focus future marketing efforts, so it was critical for me to have a clear understanding of the relationship between the different types of marketing and the revenue they generated.

This activity helped develop my knowledge of linear regression and my skills in evaluating regression results, which will prepare me for modeling to provide business recommendations in the future.

**The features in the data are:**
   * TV promotion budget (in millions of dollars)
   * Social media promotion budget (in millions of dollars)
   * Radio promotion budget (in millions of dollars)
   * Sales (in millions of dollars)

**Code:** [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Taimoor109/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Linear%20Regression%20Model/simple%20linear%20regression.ipynb)

**The purpose:** of this project is to investigate and build the regression model.

**Skills:** EDA, data analysis, hypothesis testing, Simple linear regression, R-squared, data visualization.  

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib.  

**Results:** Among TV, social media, and radio, TV had the strongest positive linear relationship with sales. The linear regression model estimates that 99.9% of the variation in sales is explained by the TV promotional budget. In other words, nearly all of the variation in sales can be explained by the TV promotional budget alone, making TV an excellent predictor of sales.
